# MLND Deep Learning Capstone
Using deep learning and tensorflow to detect Street View House Number

## Source Code
I tried to make the source code namings to be as clear as possible, but here are the files that make up this project
- `01-Download and Extraction.ipynb`
- `02-Exploration.ipynb`
- `03-Data Preparation.ipynb`
- `04-Model Training.ipynb`
- `05-Prediction.ipynb`

## Requirements

This project requires **Python 3.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [SciPy library](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html)
- [Six](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/)
- [h5py](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/h5py/)
- [Pillow](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

## Run

Open `Ipython Notebook` in the root folder. I learnt that command would be changed to `Jupyter Notebook`
